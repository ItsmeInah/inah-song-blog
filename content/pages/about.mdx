# 👋 Hi there, I'm Inah Song.

I'm an IT Project Manager with a background in media & computer science, currently expanding into software development.

Over the past few years, I've worked at the intersection of **enterprise IT**, **data security**, and **project management**—leading cross-functional initiatives across security compliance, internal audit response, procurement, legal review, budgeting, and vendor coordination. I've also responded to global IT audits and led bilingual (KR/EN) communications for internal and external stakeholders.

Now, I'm transitioning into a new chapter: **building what I used to manage.**

This site is my digital notebook—where I document things I’ve learned, ideas I’ve explored, and my evolving perspective on technology, work, and growth. You’ll find thoughts on the industries I’ve worked in, books I’ve read, and lessons I’ve picked up along the way.
